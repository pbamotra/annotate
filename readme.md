## What is it?

It is a simple web app that lets you write Markdown side notes around your code,
without editing the source files.

The idea is to write notes and comments outside the code so that code stays
 clean and short.

We intent to use for  personal note taking to understand code,
writing [tutorials](http://blog.varunajayasiri.com/ml/transformer.html),
and for collaboration.

ðŸš§ This project is still in infant stage,
and slowly improving.

## How to use

Compile `TypeScript` files in folder `ui` using compile directives defined in `tsconfig.ts`.

Run `server/ann.py` from the folder with your python source code.

Go to `localhost:8888/static/index.html`
